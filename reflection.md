I started off by feeding CHATgpt the existing image and html file, and had it explain to me what changes I would need to make to get the result I wanted. It did a pretty good job, but it did feel like cheating, so I decided not to use it much anymore. The remaining tweaks I researched online how to do them.

For example, I looked online how to create a color gradient.

However, I could not figure out how to arrange the quiz section without editing the html, so I asked chatgpt again.

Creating the colored bullet points was very hard, and I couldn't find a way of adding the blue divider lines without adding them in the html code too.

I used copilot for comments.
